OnePass
===

**One** password, **no** persistence.

###Description:
Written in Go, this password manager asks for only **two** things:

    1. Your personally chosen master password.
    2. The name of the account you're trying to log into.
<br>
With just those two pieces of information, OnePass will generate a secure, random password for you to use on your favorite sites.
